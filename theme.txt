Your life is currency
---------------------

An interpretation of the theme:
You have to give something valuable in order to get something valuable in return.

Idea 1
------

"You" could be not simply a person/individual but a community, say that we are in charge of
a city and we can exchange the life of our citizens for something.
"Currency" implies some kind of exchange of goods?
Could be some kind of city building game where we have to exchange some of our citizens for
something, but without killing the morale and also it might make buildings too slow to build or
something.

Idea 2
------

You have to shield yourself from enemies somehow. In order to gain more items or stuff, you can
trade your *time*. Basically, you choose an item you want, and it will freeze you for a specific
amount of time, during which you can’t defend yourself, and if you survive it then you get your
item. Maybe the enemies become more and more aggressive/numerous/powerful, so you need more and more
items to shield yourself, and so on.
No health points, if they find you you’re dead. Items you could get are things to shelter yourself,
things to kill enemies, other ideas?
It should be somewhat strategic in that most items that you get from trading your time are temporary
(e.g. a bomb), so useless in the long run as more and more enemies appear (and the price of those
items stay the same).

Twist! When you die, your enemies use your life as currency! To do what, I’m not sure yet.
